# Greg Repo Overview
 
Repo: `meloyelo51/greg16676935420-repo`
Active branches: `feature/greg-demo`, `docs/greg-onboarding`
 
This repo hosts **WordPress Greg** â€” a repo-first assistant that ships code and docs as **unified diffs** (single multi-file `changes.patch`) with a pragmatic fallback to direct writes when patches are impractical.
 
## Core Principles
1. Repo is the source of truth.
2. Patches first.
3. Safe application (preflight, index, 3-way fallback).
4. Unblock quickly if patching corrupts.
 
## Deliverables
- Unified diffs, installers when needed, Base64 chunks for binaries.

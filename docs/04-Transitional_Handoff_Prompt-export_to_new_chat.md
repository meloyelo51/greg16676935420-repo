I‚Äôm preparing to move this project under Greg‚Äôs hybrid workflow.

Please summarize the current state of this project so I can migrate it cleanly.
Follow this structure exactly so Greg can create tickets and roadmap items from it:

## Project Summary
- Project name / repo URL / default branch
- Brief one-paragraph description of what the project does and its current purpose
- Any key directories, components, or technologies (PHP, JS, build tools, APIs, etc.)

## Current Roadmap Summary
List each major feature or workstream, using these categories:
- ‚úÖ Completed successfully
- ‚öôÔ∏è In progress (active work)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Temporarily paused or removed
- üß© Stuck or broken (needs fix)
- üí° Planned / idea backlog (not yet started)

For each item, include:
- **Feature/slug name** (short descriptive name)
- **Status** (from the above categories)
- **One-line description**
- **Known impacted files or areas**
- **Any blockers or next steps** (if applicable)

## Additional Notes
- Any known testing or regression concerns
- Current patch/apply method that works best (Python one-shot, save-chat-patch.sh, etc.)
- Any style or workflow quirks Greg should preserve

Keep the response concise and well-formatted in Markdown so it can be pasted directly into Greg‚Äôs memory repo workflow.

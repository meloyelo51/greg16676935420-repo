# Greg Roadmap & Summary

## Purpose
Greg is a repo-first assistant for WordPress and web projects. He delivers changes as multi-file unified diffs (`changes.patch`) with a robust fallback to direct file writes when terminal or clipboard issues occur. The repo is the single source of truth for Greg’s behavior and state.

## What we shipped (2025-09-19)
- Paste→apply workflow: `scripts/save-chat-patch.sh` and `scripts/save-chat-patch.ps1` — run, paste diff, finish (Ctrl-D / Ctrl-Z+Enter), auto-normalize, dry-run, apply, commit.
- Apply helpers: `scripts/apply-patch.sh` and `.ps1` — normalize CRLF, ensure final newline, diffstat, apply with 3-way fallback.
- Docs: `docs/CHAT_PATCH_WORKFLOW.md`, `docs/PATCH_PIPELINE_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`, `docs/USING_GREG.md`, `docs/GREG_REPO_OVERVIEW.md`, `docs/HYBRID_MODE.md`, `docs/PROJECT_BOOTSTRAP.md`.
- CHANGELOG seeded with Testing Notes.

## Short-term (next 1–2 sprints)
1. CI job to validate `changes.patch` applies on a clean checkout.
2. `scripts/new-changelog-entry.sh` to append templated entries + capture test commands.
3. Optional feature-branch auto-create in `save-chat-patch` (e.g., `feature/chat-YYYYMMDD-HHMM`).
4. `scripts/split-b64.(sh|ps1)` to chunk binaries and generate reassembler + SHA-256 verify.

## Mid-term (3–6 sprints)
1. CI gating: require changelog entry + patch sanity.
2. `scripts/bootstrap-project.sh` to copy helpers and run smoke test in new repos.
3. Hybrid index: `projects/index.yml` + index README/dashboard generator.
4. Lint & security: PHPCS (WP), PHPStan, Prettier/ESLint, npm/composer audit.

## Long-term / optional
- Dashboard from `projects/index.yml` (HTML/Markdown).
- GitHub App/bot to accept pasted patches and open PRs (separate auth).

## Testing & Feedback Notes
- Each patch should include **Testing Notes** in `CHANGELOG.md` with commands and results.
- Keep push **manual** by default; add auto-push later only behind flags + CI.

## Start a new project with Greg
1. Add `.ai/assistant-context.md` (repo, branch, delivery).
2. Copy `scripts/` helpers and `.gitattributes` from this repo.
3. Smoke test:
    ./scripts/save-chat-patch.sh "docs: pipeline smoke"
    (paste a tiny two-file diff; Ctrl-D in Git Bash / Ctrl-Z then Enter in PowerShell)

## Memory vs Repo
Greg has **no cross-chat memory**. The repo (especially `.ai/assistant-context.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`) is the persistent state.

+# Greg Roadmap & Summary
+
+## Purpose
+Greg is a repo-first assistant for WordPress and web projects. He delivers changes as multi-file unified diffs (`changes.patch`) with a robust fallback to direct file writes when terminal or clipboard issues occur. The repo is the single source of truth for Greg's behavior and state.
+
+## What we shipped (2025-09-19)
+- Paste→apply workflow: `scripts/save-chat-patch.sh` and `scripts/save-chat-patch.ps1` — run, paste diff, finish (Ctrl-D / Ctrl-Z+Enter), auto-normalize, dry-run, apply, commit.
+- Apply helpers: `scripts/apply-patch.sh` and PowerShell variant — normalize CRLF, ensure final newline, diffstat, apply with 3-way fallback.
+- Docs: `docs/CHAT_PATCH_WORKFLOW.md`, `docs/PATCH_PIPELINE_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`, `docs/USING_GREG.md`, `docs/GREG_REPO_OVERVIEW.md`.
+- CHANGELOG.md seeded and populated with today's entry (testing notes included).
+
+## Short-term priorities (next 1–2 sprints)
+1. Add CI job to validate `changes.patch` applies cleanly on a fresh clone (GitHub Actions).
+2. Add a `scripts/new-changelog-entry.sh` helper to insert templated changelog sections and capture test commands automatically.
+3. Add optional branch auto-create to `save-chat-patch` (feature branch naming convention).
+4. Add `scripts/split-b64.sh` for chunking large binaries + reassembler script generator.
+
+## Mid-term priorities (3–6 sprints)
+1. CI gating for changelog presence and patch sanity.
+2. Repo bootstrap CLI (`scripts/bootstrap-project.sh`) to copy helpers & run the smoke test in new repos.
+3. Hybrid index repo support: generator for `projects/index.yml` and an index README generator.
+4. Add lint and security checks (PHPCS, PHPStan, npm audit).
+
+## Long-term / optional
+- Dashboard generator that compiles `projects/index.yml` into an HTML/Markdown dashboard.
+- Tight integrations: GitHub App / bot that can receive pasted patches and open PRs automatically (requires separate auth).
+
+## Testing & Feedback Notes
+- Every delivered patch should include a short **Testing Notes** section in the changelog with commands used and verification results.
+- Keep push manual by default. If enabling auto-push later, gate behind an opt-in flag and CI checks.
+
+## How to start a new project with Greg
+1. Add `.ai/assistant-context.md` to the new repo (repo, default branch, delivery preference).
+2. Copy `scripts/` helpers and `.gitattributes` from this repo.
+3. Run the smoke test:
+   ```bash
+   ./scripts/save-chat-patch.sh "docs: pipeline smoke"
+   # paste two-file smoke diff, Ctrl-D/Ctrl-Z+Enter
+   ```
+
+## Notes about memory vs repo
+- Greg does *not* retain cross-chat memory. The repo files (especially `.ai/assistant-context.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`) are the persistent state. Always update the repo when you want Greg to remember a project-level decision.
+
+## Want more automation?
+See the Short-term and Mid-term priority lists. Pick one and I’ll ship a targeted patch (CI, changelog helper, branch auto-create, or chunked binary helper).
